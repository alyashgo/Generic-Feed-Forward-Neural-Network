# Generic-Feed-Forward-Neural-Network
This repository contains a general ffnn architecture, specifically built and tuned for a subset of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
The network can be used on a general dataset after proper pre-processing and can be tuned with the help of the tutorial attached.
The tutorial on tuning the network gives a systematic approach to tune the neural network for better performance.
